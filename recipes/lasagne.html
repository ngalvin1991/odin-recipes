     <h3>For the ragu sauce</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>250g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>20g butter</li>
        <li>100g smoked diced pancetta (or British free-range chopped streaky bacon)</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1 carrot, finely chopped </li>
        <li>2 celery sticks, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 fat garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>200g British beef or veal mince </li>
        <li>200g British free-range pork mince  </li>
        <li>200ml whole milk </li>
        <li>Fresh nutmeg for grating </li>
        <li>175ml dry white wine </li>
        <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes </li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh oregano</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>For the bechamel sauce</h3>
     <ul>
     <li>60g unsalted butter </li>
     <li>60g plain flour</li>
     <li>700ml whole milk</li>
     <li>80g parmesan, finely grated</li>
     <li>Pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step By Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the ragù, melt the 20g butter in a large ovenproof pan over a medium heat and gently fry the pancetta for about 8 minutes until crisp and the fat has rendered. Add the onion, carrot, celery and garlic, then soften gently for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the beef/veal and pork mince to the pan and fry, stirring to break up any lumps. Pour in the milk, grate over a little nutmeg, then simmer very gently for 20-30 minutes. Heat the oven to 150°C/130°C fan/gas 2.</li>
        <li>Stir the wine, tomatoes and most of the oregano into the pan, then season. Cover with the lid slightly ajar, then oven-cook for 3 hours until the meat is tender and the sauce is thick. Check every now and then, adding a little water if needed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the bechamel. Melt the 60g butter in a medium heavy-based pan over a medium-high heat. Add the flour and stir for 3-4 minutes until the mixture starts to smell toasty. Gradually add the milk, then simmer, whisking, for 6-8 minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat, stir in 20g of the parmesan and a good grating of fresh nutmeg, then season well.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread a little of the bechamel or ragù over the base of the baking dish, then cover with slightly overlapping lasagne sheets. Spoon over a third of the bechamel, sprinkle with a little of the remaining parmesan, then top with half the ragù. Add another layer of lasagne, then top with half the remaining bechamel and all the remaining ragù. Add the final layer of lasagne, then spread with the remaining bechamel. Scatter with the rest of the parmesan, then set aside for a bit – ideally overnight in the fridge, but an hour at room temperature will do (see Make Ahead).</li>
        <li>When ready to bake, heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Bake the lasagne for 40-45 minutes until golden and bubbling. Garnish with the remaining oregano to serve.</li>
    </ol>
